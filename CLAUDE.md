# Project Directions

I'm working on this project with my brother.

> Guys wanna hear my strategy on how to HFT in kalshi
> Step one: go to BTC up down 15 minutes
> Step two: calculate the variance / sharpe ratio of BTC over the past few hours (days? Find optimal time frame)
> Use in formula assuming up and downwards trends are random
> Then Find the distribution of outcomes to find percentage chance of above or below target price
> Lastly use api to buy inefficiently priced bits (with some margin or error to beat transaction fees and model potentially being shit)
